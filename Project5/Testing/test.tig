/* This is the test case file. Here is the requirement:
    1. The test case file must be a valid Tiger program. No syntax errors allowed.
    2. The table below has two columns. The first column specifies Tiger construct that must be covered, and
       the second column gives the line # of the statement that is used to test the construct. Please fill the second
       column after you have designed all test cases successfully.
       
        Tiger Construct to be covered                                            Line # of the statement
     Two variables with the same name are defined at the same level                      #21, 22
     Two types with the same name are defined at the same level                          #23, 24
     Two variables with the same name are defined at the different nesting levels        #25, 29
     Two types with the same name are defined at the different nesting levels            #26, 30
     An undefined variable is used                                                       #35
     An undefined type is used                                                           #36
     An undefined variable is used in function parameter list                            #37
